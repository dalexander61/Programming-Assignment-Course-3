The script run_analysis.R performs the following function to create two tidy data sets:
 - loads and merges the training and test data sets into one data set.  Each data set consists of 3 files that are all merged.
 - replaces the column names from the features.txt file
 - replaces the activity number codes with the activity names from the activity_labels.txt file
 - prunes the columns to only include columns related to mean and standard deviation
This ends up with a tidy data set.

In addition, further analysis is done and written out in a tidy.txt file.
 - The above data set is grouped by subject and activity
 - the mean of each column is calculated by subject/activity pairs
 - the resulting data table is written out to a file names 'tidy.txt'
